                efficiency. While it might be tempting to clean the panels
                yourself, professional solar panel cleaning offers numerous
                safety advantages that make it the better option. In this
                article, we'll delve into these safety benefits and explain why

                Risks of DIY Solar Panel Cleaning
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Cleaning solar panels might seem straightforward, but it comes
                with several risks that can endanger your safety and damage your
                panels.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Potential Hazards:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">
                    Falls and Injuries: Climbing onto roofs or ladders without
                    proper safety equipment increases the risk of falls and
                    injuries. The height and angle of roofs can make them
                    particularly dangerous for untrained individuals.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    Electric Shock: Solar panels generate electricity, and
                    improper handling can result in electric shock. Even when
                    panels are not actively producing energy, they can still
                    hold a residual charge.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    Damage to Panels: Using the wrong cleaning solutions or
                    tools can scratch or damage the panels, reducing their
                    efficiency and lifespan.
