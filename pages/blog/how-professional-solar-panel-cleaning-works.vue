                Solar Panel Cleaning in San Bernardino
            </h3>
            <p>
                Consider the Hernandez family, who live in the dusty outskirts
                of San Bernardino. After noticing a significant drop in their
                solar power generation, they hired a professional cleaning
                service. The cleaners identified heavy dust accumulation and
                bird droppings as the primary issues. Post-cleaning, the family
                saw a 25% increase in their energy output, showcasing the
                effectiveness of professional cleaning.

            <p>
                San Bernardino’s arid and occasionally windy climate can lead to

                They use techniques that minimize water usage—a critical
                consideration in drought-prone Southern California—and ensure
                that no mineral residues are left behind, which can be common
                with hard water in the region.
