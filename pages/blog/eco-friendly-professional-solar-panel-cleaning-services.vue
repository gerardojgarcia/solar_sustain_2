                <li>
                    <strong>Location-Based Frequency:</strong> Areas with high
                    dust, pollen, or pollution levels may require more frequent
                    cleaning, possibly every 3-4 months.

                <li>
                    <strong>Seasonal Cleaning:</strong> Spring and fall are
                    optimal times for cleaning, as pollen and leaves can
                    accumulate on the panels during these seasons.

                <li>
                    <strong>Post-Weather Event Cleaning:</strong> After severe
