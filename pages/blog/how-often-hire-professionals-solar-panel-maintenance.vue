            <p>
                Solar panels are a fantastic investment for both your wallet and
                the environment. They provide clean energy and can significantly
                reduce your electricity bills. However, to keep them operating
                at peak efficiency, regular maintenance is essential. In this
                article, we'll explore how often you should hire professionals
                for solar panel maintenance, with a focus on residents in San
                Bernardino County. We'll also discuss the benefits of
                professional services and what you can expect during a
                maintenance visit.

                Maintaining your solar panels is crucial to ensure they operate
                at maximum efficiency. While solar panels are relatively low
                maintenance, professional cleaning and inspection are
                recommended to keep them in optimal condition.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">General Guidelines:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Every 6 to 12 months: It is advisable to have your solar panels
                professionally cleaned and inspected every 6 to 12 months. This
                frequency can vary depending on your local climate and
                environmental conditions. For instance, areas with high dust,
                pollen, or bird activity might require more frequent cleanings.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
                Seasonal Considerations:
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                San Bernardino County: Given the dry, dusty conditions typical
                of San Bernardino County, more frequent cleanings might be
                necessary. Dust and debris can accumulate quickly, reducing the
                panels' efficiency.
